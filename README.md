👋 Yo, I’m @Solorush2021
I’m out here grinding, slinging code, and building products that actually works. No tutorials, no fluff—just me wrestling with bugs and shipping projects that hit.

👀 What I’m cooking: I’m deep in AI, tweaking neural nets with TensorFlow to make models that don’t choke on real data. Also banging out JavaScript apps with React and Node.js—think dashboards that load fast and don’t crash. Oh, and I’m scraping sites for data ‘cause manual work is for normal people.
🌱 What I’m sweating over: Right now, I’m debugging a Python script to automate some API calls—tryna cut my workflow time in half. Also messing with Web3 contracts in Solidity, but gas fees are pissing me off. Learning Docker too, ‘cause containers are life.
💞️ Let’s build some shit: I’m down to collab on AI projects (like training a model to roast bad code), open-source tools, or anything that needs a JavaScript or Python fix. If you got a crazy idea, I’m game—just no boring CRUD apps.
